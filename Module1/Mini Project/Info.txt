My name is Shruti Suman and I'm making a mini project on Report Card Generation. 
In this miniproject at first I'm getting the number of students in a class and then take input of all the details of the students.
Details include
a. Name 
b. Semester
c. IA 1 marks
d. IA 2 marks
e. End Term marks
Then I'm assigning roll number to students as per the alphabetical order. Roll number is starting from 1.
I'm taking here 5 subjects 
Then I'm calculating the final percentage of a student as 30% of IA and 70% of End Term.
As per the final percentage I'm assigning rank to every student.
Then I'm taking input of roll number of a student to generate the result of that particular student. 
Rank and marks and other details are also displayed in the output.
I'll be uploading directly on my github folder the screenshots of
a. the input I'm giving as student details
b. the output I'm getting as the scorecard of a selected student.
